Changes in Krackle 0.7.8

- Fixes partition rotation.  Quick rotate is no longer a supported configuration item.  Instead all topic meta data refreshes will rotate partitions and if quicker rotation is required than topic.metadata.refresh.interval.ms can be configured accordingly.
- Fixes permission issues in the RPM creation with directories being created as 644 and not 755
- Defaults user 'klogger' in config/klogger-env.sh
- Reduces heap size to 2GB (from 5GB)' in config/klogger-env.sh

Changes in Krackle 0.7.7:

- Adds a new BrokerUnavailableException exception
- Adds a new configuration parameter: socket.timeout.seconds (defaults to 30s)
- Adds a new attribute to Consumer: private Broker broker to identify the current broker
- Adds a new method to Broker: getNiceDescription()
- All attempts to create open socket connection to a broker now set a timeout
- All SocketTimeoutException now log the error and call connectToBroker()
- connectToBroker() now attempts a max number of connections before throwing a BrokerUnavailableException
