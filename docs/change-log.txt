Changes in Krackle 0.8.1:

- Bumps dependency version of snappy to 1.1.1.7
- Fixes bug (transposed parameters) that would cause a corrupt message sent to Kafka after a partition rotation

Changes in Krackle 0.8.0:

- Supports bdp-common 0.0.6 which provides all logging and monitoring deps
- Instruments log4j2 with io.dropwizard.metrics
- Removes the force=true|false parameter in updateMetaDataAndConnection()
- toSendBuffer is updated with partition after exceptions raised in sendMessage() incur a call to updateMetadataAndConnection()

Changes in Krackle 0.7.10

- Sets the keep alive flag on the consumer's broker socket to true

Changes in Krackle 0.7.9

- Adds the option for no rotation, sequential rotation or random rotation through partitions.
- Changes how the transit time to kafka is calculated - now uses System.currentTimeMillis instead of nano second resolution.

Changes in Krackle 0.7.8

- Fixes partition rotation.  Quick rotate is no longer a supported configuration item.  Instead all topic meta data refreshes will rotate partitions and if quicker rotation is required than topic.metadata.refresh.interval.ms can be configured accordingly.  Regular topic specific overrides are possible as well for topics that require faster rotaiton.
- Fixes permission issues in the RPM creation with directories being created as 644 and not 755

Changes in Krackle 0.7.7:

- Adds a new BrokerUnavailableException exception
- Adds a new configuration parameter: socket.timeout.seconds (defaults to 30s)
- Adds a new attribute to Consumer: private Broker broker to identify the current broker
- Adds a new method to Broker: getNiceDescription()
- All attempts to create open socket connection to a broker now set a timeout
- All SocketTimeoutException now log the error and call connectToBroker()
- connectToBroker() now attempts a max number of connections before throwing a BrokerUnavailableException
